## üìñ About The Project

This project was created to automate the repetitive task of fishing in the game *Raft*. By using computer vision to detect the on-screen prompt, this bot allows players to gather a steady supply of food and resources passively. This frees up valuable time for players to manage their raft, explore islands, and advance through the game's story without the constant need to monitor their fishing rod.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Automatic Prompt Detection:** Uses OpenCV to accurately detect the "LMB" fish-bite icon on the screen.
* **Automated Reeling:** Simulates mouse clicks to automatically reel in the fish as soon as it's hooked.
* **Background Operation:** Runs quietly in the background with minimal performance impact.
* **User-Friendly:** Available as a simple, standalone `.exe` file that requires no installation. Just run and play.
* **Customizable:** Key parameters like screen region and detection threshold can be easily adjusted in the source code.
